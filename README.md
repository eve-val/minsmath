A quick python script to make reprocessing decisions easier

To use:
* Clone the repository to your computer
* Obtain a copy of evelink as well as the invTypes, invTypeMaterals, mapSolarSystems, and staStations static data dump tables as .yaml files (this step is non-trivial and means this program is difficult to use for non-VN folks)
* Update prices.csv with the correct mineral prices from the market
* Run database.py. This will take a while to go.
* Run minerals\_calculator.py. 

To implement:
* GUI
* CLI with arguments passed in
* Look inside _all_ the containers
