A quick python script to make reprocessing decisions easier

To use:
* Clone the repository to your computer
* Update prices.csv with the correct mineral prices from the market (TODO: import from EVE-Central)
* Ctrl-A (or cmd-a) to select the reprocessing output for your module, then paste the output into mins.txt
* Save, and run the script!
